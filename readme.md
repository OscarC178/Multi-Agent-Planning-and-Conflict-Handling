# The Green Room

**Live Demo:** [The Green Room](https://the-green-room-94621334034.us-west1.run.app/)

**The Green Room** is a sequential multi-agent collaboration tool designed to facilitate complex workflows that require distinct personas, rigorous fact-checking, and structured actionable outcomes.

Unlike standard single-window chat interfaces, The Green Room orchestrates a lineup of specialized AI agents that pass context sequentially. This architecture is specifically built to weigh pros and cons without the "echo chamber" effect, ensuring higher accuracy and verified outputs.

## 🚀 Key Features

-   **Sequential Multi-Agent Architecture**: Breaks complex problems down into linear steps handled by specialized agents. This reduces context pollution and allows each agent to excel at a specific role.
-   **Adversarial Persona Analysis**: Facilitates robust decision-making by assigning conflicting goals to different agents (e.g., "The Innovator" vs. "The Risk Officer"). This ensures a comprehensive evaluation of pros and cons without the dilution common in single-window chats.
-   **The Moderator Agent**: A dedicated "Human-in-the-Loop" proxy that automatically fact-checks outputs, corrects hallucinations, and synthesizes conflicting viewpoints before the workflow proceeds.
-   **Dynamic Context Injection**: Users can pause the chat flow at any moment to inject additional context or steer the direction, giving you granular control over the final output.
-   **Persona Documentation**: Upload documents to specific agents to ground their responses in your specific data or brand voice.
-   **Actionable Deliverables**: The system is designed to produce concrete "Next Step Actions" and "Key Feedback" rather than generic chat text.

## 💡 The "Single Window" Problem vs. The Green Room

When you ask a standard, single-window LLM to "weigh the pros and cons," it often fails to provide deep critical analysis due to **Context Smoothing**.

In a single window, the model tries to balance all viewpoints simultaneously. This leads to:
* **The Echo Chamber Effect:** The model tends to agree with your initial premise rather than challenging it.
* **Diluted Arguments:** Strong "Cons" are softened immediately by "Pros" in the same paragraph, preventing a truly rigorous critique.
* **Persona Bleed:** It struggles to inhabit a "Legal Risk" persona and a "Creative Blue-Sky" persona simultaneously without blending their logic.

**How The Green Room Solves This:**
1.  **Enforced Diversity of Thought:** We assign distinct, isolated personas to specific stages. Agent A generates ambitious ideas without worrying about feasibility. Agent B critiques them ruthlessly. Because they run sequentially, Agent A cannot dilute Agent B's critique.
2.  **The Moderator as Synthesis Engine:** Instead of the user trying to make sense of conflicting advice, the **Moderator Agent** acts as the final judge. It takes the unadulterated output from previous agents, fact-checks it, and produces a balanced "Next Step" action plan.
3.  **No Hallucination Cascades:** The sequential pause feature allows you to catch and correct a specific agent's error before it poisons the rest of the chain.

## 🛠️ Built With

-   **Google AI Studio**: Powered by Gemini models (specifically optimized for `gemini-2.5-pro` and `gemini-2.5-flash`).
-   [Insert your Frontend Framework, e.g., Streamlit/Next.js]
-   [Insert your Backend/Hosting, e.g., Google Cloud Run]

## 📦 Usage

1.  **Select your Agents**: Choose the persona lineup relevant to your task (e.g., Debate Mode).
2.  **Upload Context**: Attach relevant PDFs or text files to ground the agents.
3.  **Start the Chain**: Input your initial prompt.
4.  **Monitor & Intervene**: Watch the sequential handover. Use the **Pause** function if an agent veers off course or requires new information.
5.  **Review**: Check the final "Key Feedback" and "Next Steps" generated by the Moderator.
